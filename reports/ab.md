# Apache Benchmark

Simple benchmark of the hello world resource.

## Test

Test the service with CURL:

```
curl -v -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @reports/req.body.json \
  http://0.0.0.0:4000/hub/01:23:45:67:89:AB


```

## Run

Flags:

* `-c` number of concurrent requests
* `-n` number of requests to send
* `-k` keep connections alive to avoid [running out of ports](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1217100)

Command to generate the report:

    mix run --no-halt
    ab -k -n 10000 -c 16 \
       -p reports/req.body.json \
       http://0.0.0.0:4000/hub/01:23:45:67:89:AB >> reports/ab.md
